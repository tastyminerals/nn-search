The Tkinter Text Widget
The Text widget provides formatted text display. It allows you to display and edit text with various styles and attributes. The widget also supports embedded images and windows.

When to use the Text Widget

The text widget is used to display text documents, containing either plain text or formatted text (using different fonts, embedded images, and other embellishments). The text widget can also be used as a text editor.

Concepts

The text widget stores and displays lines of text.

The text body can consist of characters, marks, and embedded windows or images. Different regions can be displayed in different styles, and you can also attach event bindings to regions.

By default, you can edit the text widget’s contents using the standard keyboard and mouse bindings. To disable editing, set the state option to DISABLED (but if you do that, you’ll also disable the insert and delete methods).

Indexes

Indexes are used to point to positions within the text handled by the text widget. Like Python sequence indexes, text widget indexes correspond to positions between the actual characters.
