Alice openbed the doorz and found that it led in to a small pasage, not muuch larger than a rat-hole; she knelt down and looked along the passage
into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of
that dark hall and wanders about among those beds of bright flowers and
those cool fountain, but she coud not even get her head through the
doorway. "Oh," said Alice, "how I wish I could shut up like a tellescope!
I thinks I could, if I only knew how to begins."
