**nn-search2** is a [part-of-speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech) tagging and text search utility based on [NLTK](www.nltk.org), [TextBlob](textblob.readthedocs.org/en/dev/) and [matplotlib](matplotlib.org).
It uses state-of-the-art pos-tagger based on [Averaged Perceptron](http://www.spacy.io/blog/part-of-speech-POS-tagger-in-python) which provides fast and accurate results.
Above that, one of the main **nn-search2** features is full text part-of-speech search extended with word 
ranges such that you can find chains of nouns, verbs, adjectives and phrases or even fixed expressions.
